# ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers

I forked this script from [Roger Pack's ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers](https://github.com/rdp/ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers) in order to compile a Windows XP compatible static and shared FFmpeg build that runs on my old pc with non-SSE2 cpu.
FFmpeg has officially dropped support for Windows XP, but I'll try to update the script nonetheless and release some fresh builds so every now and then.
See [Making Zeranoe builds work under XP & XP builds by rogerdpack](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=3572) on Zeranoe's forum.
You can download my builds from [my website](http://rwijnsma.home.xs4all.nl/files/ffmpeg).
