# ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers

This script is forked from [Roger Pack's ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers](https://github.com/rdp/ffmpeg-windows-build-helpers).  
My main goal was to compile a static and shared FFmpeg build that runs on my old pc with non-SSE2 cpu and WinXP.  
I'll try to update the script and [release some fresh builds](http://rwijnsma.home.xs4all.nl/files/ffmpeg) so every now and then.
